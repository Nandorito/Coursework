# Coursework
Here I will upload each of my assignments in class to keep track of my own progress. 

Each assignment builds on the last and is limited to the scope of the current chapter in our course. This may result in some code that is not efficient since I was limited to only stick to the course material. For example, in the earlier assignments I could not use loops/functions/arrays/pointers etc.
